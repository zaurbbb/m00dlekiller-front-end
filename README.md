# m00dlekiller
Moodlekiller is Front-End realization of site, which is used in our University (AITU). 

The project started with idea "how this site might look like?". 

So, you can see the result by this link: https://bioneisme.github.io/m00dlekiller/index.html.

The site was developed in cleanly HTML code with bootstrap 5.

Also, we used jquery for faster and comfortable work with DOM. 

At the end, there's full adaptability for any device.

Responsibilities: 

zaurbbb — frontend foundation (structure of pages + main page + courses page)

bioneisme — support and node.js foundation (profile page + registration page + 404page)
